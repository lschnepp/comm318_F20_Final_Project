## The Use of Lethal Drugs by Age -- Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

initial_data_exploration.ipynb - This notebook first cleans/normalizes the data, then explores the scope of the data. 
    * Number_of_Drug_and_Alcohol-Related_Intoxication_Deaths_by_Place_of_Occurrence__2007-2016_1__2_.csv - looks at  drug and alcohol related deaths in Maryland by place of occurrence. I did not use this notebook in my data story presentation because it was not super relevant. However, this notebook allowed me to practice code that I would be using to analyze my other sources. However, this notebook did show me that drug related deaths were increasing over time. 

initial_data_analysis.ipynb -- This notebook analyzes the data in the data file Total_Number_of_Drug_Intoxication_Deaths_by_Selected_Substances__2007-2016.csv which looks at the total number of Drug Intoxicated deaths separated by substance in Maryland. This notebook allowed me to investigate the data within the context of my first research question, what drug is most lethal? In this notebook I go through steps to be able to answer this question.

further_data_analysis -- This notebook analyzes the data in the data frame drug-use-by-age.csv. This data looks at substance use and frequency by age group. Use is measuered by the percentage of those in an age group who used a substance in the past 12 months. Frequency is the median number of times a user in an age group used a substance in the past 12 months. In this notebook, I analyze the data within the context of my research questions. I compare how different age groups engage with specific substances.
