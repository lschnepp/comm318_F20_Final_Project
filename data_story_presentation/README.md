## The Use of Lethal Drugs by Age

My data story presentation is in the form of an academic report, and is tailored to researchers, scholars, and students interested in the topic. 

My research question: What is the most lethal drug and how does drug consumption affect a person depending on age?

First, in my data story, I introduce what I will be investigating and why it is important. 

Next, I walk the reader through some of my analyses that aided my findings to the research question, and why these analyses are important. Under the analysis section I broke up my two questions in sections. The first question I examined was What is the most lethal drug? I went through some analyses and showed how drug use has increased from 2010-2016 by using a bar graph. I also showed the increased progression of deaths associated with the four most lethal drugs I found in my data analysis notebook by using a bar graph. Lastly, to solidify the answer to my question I decided to use outside sources to investigate how lethal the four drugs are and their side affects indicated by the in test citation (Murray, 2020). The data used to answer this is from the data file Total_Number_of_Drug_Intoxication_Deaths_by_Selected_Substances__2007-2016.csv, in my initial_data_analysis. 

Then, I did a similar presentation for my second research question:how does drug consumption affect a person depending on age? To answer this question I utilized the data in the file drug-use-by-age.csv in my further_data_analysis notebook, that looks at use of substances by age. I looked at the consumption of specific drugs in four different age ranges: 12-17, 18-25, 25-64, and 65+. I decided to focus on alcohol and cocaine because they were the two out of the four drugs that I found to be most lethal. I examined the relationship between age and use and used isolated charts to look at each age group and substance use. 

Lastly, I decided to discuss all of the findings and why these questions are important to investigate. In my discussion I used an outside source to help aid how these two questions correlate. This source is indicated within my data story using the in text citation(Christiansen, 2020).
